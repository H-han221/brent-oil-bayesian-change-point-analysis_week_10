# brent-oil-bayesian-change-point-analysis_week_10
Bayesian change point analysis of Brent oil prices to quantify the impact of major geopolitical, economic, and OPEC-related events using PyMC and time series methods.
## Project Overview

This project applies Bayesian Change Point Analysis to historical Brent oil prices (1987–2022) to identify structural breaks in price behavior and associate them with major geopolitical, economic, and OPEC-related events.

The analysis supports data-driven decision-making for investors, policymakers, and energy companies by quantifying how significant global events influence oil price dynamics under uncertainty.

Key techniques include:
- Time series exploratory analysis
- Log-return transformation and stationarity testing
- Bayesian inference using PyMC
- Probabilistic change point detection
- Event-based interpretation of market regime shifts
