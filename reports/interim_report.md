## Assumptions and Limitations

### Key Assumptions
- Brent oil price dynamics can be partially explained by changes in statistical properties (mean and volatility).
- Major geopolitical, economic, and OPEC-related events influence market expectations and behavior.
- Log returns are a suitable transformation to stabilize variance and support time series modeling.
- Market reactions may occur slightly before or after the documented event dates.

### Correlation vs Causation
This analysis identifies statistical change points in the time series and compares their timing with known real-world events. While temporal alignment suggests potential associations, it does not prove causal impact.

Change point detection highlights *when* a structural change occurs, but not *why* it occurs. Multiple overlapping factors—including speculation, currency movements, and global demand—may contribute to observed price changes. Therefore, all event associations are interpreted as hypotheses rather than definitive causal conclusions.
## Communication of Results

To ensure insights are actionable for different stakeholders, results will be communicated using multiple formats:

- **Investors:**  
  Concise reports and interactive dashboards highlighting regime shifts, volatility changes, and probabilistic price impacts.

- **Policymakers:**  
  Written analytical reports supported by visual evidence of structural breaks, focusing on economic stability and energy security implications.

- **Energy Companies:**  
  Dashboards and summary briefs emphasizing operational risk, supply disruptions, and price uncertainty.

Primary communication channels include:
- A written analytical report (PDF or Medium-style blog)
- An interactive web-based dashboard (Flask + React)
- Visual summaries and plots embedded in presentations
